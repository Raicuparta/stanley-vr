# Before installing

Disable the Steam Game Theatre to prevent it from starting up when you're trying to play StanleyVR:
    - Right click Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe on Steam.
    - Select Properties.
    - Under "General", disable "Use Desktop Game Theatre".

# Installing

To install this mod, extract the contents of this zip to your Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe game folder.
Usually that would be something like "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe".
After extracting, the file "winhttp.dll" should be on the same folder as "The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe.exe".

# Controller Inputs

I have included input bindings for Oculus, Index, Vive, and WMR.
If they aren't comfortable for you, please let me know and send me suggestions of better bindings.

The game will show you XBox controller input prompts, which won't match your VR controller bindings.
Check the SteamVR input bindings window to learn the controls.

Most of the controls should be easy enough to guess, except for the recenter button.
In most controllers, you can recenter by holding L3 or R3 (clicking and holding either analog stick).
For Vive controllers, recenter by holding either menu button.

# Recentering

There are some issues with the player position not matching the camera position.
You should probably play sitting down and avoid moving too much to keep it stable until these issues are fixed.
When you look down at the floor, you should see a shadow. If the shadow isn't underneath you, hold the recenter button.
